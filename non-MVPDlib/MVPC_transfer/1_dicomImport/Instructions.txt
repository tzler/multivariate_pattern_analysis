Prepare nifti
==dicomImport_EIB_pulldata.sh
	moves the data files from remote to local
==dicomImport_EIB_anatPopulate.m
	builds EIBanat.mat file that tells next script which run is MPRAGE. There is issue in subject SAX_EIB_67 report, actual anatomical is run 10, just like all of the rest of the subjects.
==dicomImport_EIB_MVPC.m
	generates nifti for runs indicated in EIB_subject_taskruns.mat and EIBanat.mat


To paralyze subjects using slurm

==sbatch_genScripts.m
	generates individual sbatch scripts for every subject with a folder in the project data folder (e.g. ‘sbatch_run001.m’)
==sbatch_parallel.sh
	call with ‘sbatch sbatch_parallel.sh’. in turn calls ‘sbatch_single.sh’ the indicated number of time (-n 30 in this case)
==sbatch_single.sh
	places the next ‘sbatch_run###.m’ script on the next available node
==sbatch_run###.m
	calls ‘wrapper_preproc_EIB_parallel.m’ for indicated subject ### (1-30 for EIB)
==wrapper_preproc_EIB_parallel.m
	populates Cfg_preproc variable for indicated subject and passes the variable to ‘spmBatch_masterscript_connectivity.m’
==spmBatch_masterscript_connectivity.m
	executes spm_batch commands, ART, etc.


To run subjects in serial using nohup

==Run singlethread preprocessing
==nohub_run.sh
==wrapper_preproc_EIB.m
